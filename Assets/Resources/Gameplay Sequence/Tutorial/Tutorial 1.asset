  message: 'Good evening, Ms. Trooper. Looks like we are embarking on another thrilling
    journey. Oh? I apologize, Ms., but artificial intelligence cannot be held responsible
    for the compromise. I was simply fulfilling my assigned duty. Perhaps you intentionally
    activated speaker mode to showcase your professionalism. However, rest assured,
    I will assist you in resolving this situation. I have composed a tutorial that
    I trust you will not disregard and publish negative reviews online due to your
    own negligence. '
