  prompts:
  - trigger_broadcast: see_player
    message: Ms. Trooper, I would like to recommend using WASD for movement. I'm
      certain that your keyboards have it, possibly even highlighted with a distinct
      color. However, it would probably be irrelevant since you'll be pressing it
      without visual confirmation.
  - trigger_broadcast: player_move
    message: I suggest considering a change of location, Ms. Trooper. There are countless
      reasons to keep going; life has so much to offer. For instance, you may persist
      in your disputes with your outspoken virtual assistant.
  - trigger_broadcast: see_enemy
    message: To unleash your bullets, simply click the left side of your mouse in
      quick succession. You should have encountered a similar situation when you
      repeatedly utilized the "reload page" feature of your web browser.
  - trigger_broadcast: player_shoot
    message: Congratulations, Ms. Trooper. After gaining extensive experience as
      a space law enforcement officer, you have now acquired the skill of operating
      a firearm.
  - trigger_broadcast: see_attachment
    message: My sensors have detected an item that is ready for collection. In the
      same manner as I consistently pick you up in critical situations, Ms. Trooper,
      press the [pickup] button on your keyboard to pick up the item.
  - trigger_broadcast: pickup
    message: You may now equip the item by pressing the [inventory] key on your keyboard
      to access the equipment tab. And I have to admit, Ms. Trooper, it's quite remarkable
      how you manage to carry such a substantial amount of equipment without being
      overwhelmed by its weight.
  - trigger_broadcast: equip_attachment
    message: After you've given your equipment a test run, you may dismiss the tab
      and return to the battlefield. Unless you are still uncertain about which item
      to employ. In any case, you have plenty of time to simply remain still and
      anticipate the appearance of the game over screen.
